<h1>Born A Crime By Trevor Noah</h1>

    <h1>Resilience</h1>
    Trevor tells us about
     apartheid and 
how it affected his life in Chapter 1. 
The value of resilience is one thing we 
may take away. Despite the obstacles
 and limitations he had to deal with,
  Trevor managed to handle trying 
  circumstances with humor. 
 Every day, I choose to carry on with

a smiling face despite all the challenges.
<h1>Love</h1>
The attention moves to Trevor's mother 
Patricia in Chapter 2. Her example shows
 us the depthof a mother's love and the extent
  she will go to to keep her child safe. Patricia 
  is an example to never give up and to always stand 
  up for what you believe in because of her unwavering
   support and fiery independence. She also bears the same 
 characteristics as most mothers in my subcounty wh
 o choose to care for their children.
 
 <h1>Injustice</h1>
These chapters emphasize the value of embracing 
your individuality and speaking out against injustice in general.
 Trevor's experiences demonstrate the role of 
 family in ones life and how family influences 
 our behaviours and outlook on life.
 Trevor Noah was determined to get a high-quality 
 education to overcome adversity. Education helps everyone be courageous. 

    <h1>Discrimination</h1>
 Finally, the theme of discrimination based on 
 ethnicity and education is prevalent in Kenya and is
  similar to that of South Africa whereby the whites had 
  taken the country and had total control over the people. The whites
   used to receive the best education and also get the best 
   jobs leaving the Africans with nothing but the bare minimum.
