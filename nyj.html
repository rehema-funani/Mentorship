<div id="hh"><h1>Born A Crime By Trevor Noah</h1><img src="download (1).jpeg"></div>


<p>Trevor tells us about apartheid and 
how it affected his life in Chapter 1. 
The value of resilience is one thing we 
may take away. Despite the obstacles
 and limitations he had to deal with,
  Trevor managed to handle trying 
  circumstances with humor. 
 Every day, I choose to carry on with

a smiling face despite all the challenges.
The attention moves to Trevor's mother 
Patricia in Chapter 2. Her example shows us the depth
 of a mother's love and the extent she will go 
 
 to to keep her child safe. Patricia is an example 
 to never give up and to always stand up for what you 
 believe in because of her unwavering support 
 and fiery independence. She also bears the same 
 characteristics as most mothers in my subcounty wh
 o choose to care for their children despite all 
 the mocking from society on ways they bore their children.
These chapters emphasize the value of embracing 
your individuality and speaking out against injustice in general.
 Trevor's experiences demonstrate the role of 
 family in ones life and how family influences 
 our behaviours and outlook on life.</p>
